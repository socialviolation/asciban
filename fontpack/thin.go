const Thin = `flf2a$ 6 5 8 -1 12
Based on a lowercase font posted by robert@cs.caltech.edu
Figletized by Wendell Hicken 11/93 (whicken@parasoft.com)
Explanation of first line:
flf2 - "magic number" for file identification
a    - should always be ` + "`" + `a', for now
$    - the "hardblank" -- prints as a blank, but can't be smushed
6    - height of a character
5    - height of a character, not including descenders
8    - max line length (excluding comment lines) + a fudge factor
-1   - default smushmode for this font (like "-m 15" on command line)
12   - number of comment lines
